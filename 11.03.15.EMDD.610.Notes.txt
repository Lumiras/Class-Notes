##Session 2: 11/10

###Need pleasures vs. pleasures of appreciation
"need" is a misnomer, need pleasures aren't things you need to survive, they are just something you have a very strong affinity for, to the point where using an alternative to that product may cause excessive anxiety/negative feelings in the user.

###Criticisms
This model isn't a catch-all, and things are built for a general audience...so you can't tailor the thing you make for the specifics of every user's pleasure needs.

###Value Sensitive Design

[Value Sensitive Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_sensitive_design) runs in close parallel to the Four Pleasures, but is more applicable to digital products.
