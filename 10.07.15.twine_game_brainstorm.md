##Twine game brainstorm

###Ideation
Small game, could be completed within a week or so during Fall Break, not all that elaborate

Should be completable by player in about 30 minutes, maybe more

Want to focus on cyberpunk/horror aesthetic, sort of a neon-soaked terror

Had an idea for an escape the room game, but that doesn't work all that well in Twine.

[Sam Barlow's *Aisle*](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=j49crlvd62mhwuzu) is an inspiration.

Give the illusion that it's a one-move game, but some paths allow for further exploration.

Your character is laying in a subway station in the middle of the night, dying from a gunshot wound from a Hornet gun, a close-range weapon that discharges a slug of metal shards silently using magnetics. As a result, nobody heard or saw directly what happened to you.

You start with a list of choices rattling off all the actions you can attempt in the minute or so you think you have to live. Most of them result in you dying, of course, but in those deaths you find out more and more about your character and how he got to the place he's in right now. 

There are obvious choices, like yelling for help or going to a nearby medkit, but there are also more strange choices like focusing on an advertisement on the wall or looking closely at the tiles next to your head. 

There's a definite cyclical nature to the game, as you are constantly returned to your one choice again and again. After a while, the reality of that situation changes gradually, and more options that weren't present initially are shown to you.
