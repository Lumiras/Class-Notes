##Multimedia Multitasking and Distributed Cognition Findings
My readings and research focused on the issue of media multitasking in the realm of so-called 'second screen' applications in the realm of television, video games, and other media. The readings revealed that a second screen, whether it is via a separate device (such as a smartphone) or via an integrated solution (like the Wii U's gamepad), the second screen can be a great benefit, allowing users to interact more closely with something in ways that the primary screen does not allow. Some of my research did reveal, though, that dividing a person's attention between multiple screens/interface can greatly reduce their comprehension of the information conveyed by the primary medium.
Regarding distributed cognition, I focused more on how videogames can be applied to distributed cognition, and how a diverse experience within a game is integral for sustained enjoyment of a game, as a diverse experience distributes the load on a person's mind and lets them affect things within the game in diverse ways.
