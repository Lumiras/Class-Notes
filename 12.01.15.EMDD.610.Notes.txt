Resmini and Rosati separated IA into 4 separate categorizations:

- Information Architecture
- Information Design
- Information Systems
- Information Science

These all separated from the 1970s to the 1990s, but at the end of the 90s up until today, people have sought to synthesize between these realms.

this was all mainly driven by the rise of personal technology, and the ubiquity of computer systems.
