	- Environment
[these above 3 should be done by December]
- Results
	- Write in January
	- Also very easy (according to Jenn)
	- Simply a retelling of results
	- Very mechanical
	- Make charts
	- Articulate what the results are
- Conclusion/discussion
	- Write in February
	- Hardest chapter (according to Jenn)
	- Say something meaningful
	- Start with bullet points, even at beginning of formulating thesis
	- Advise future research

Find 2 outside observers to the thesis, they will review:

- Topic
- Method
- Body
- Contribution

Entire month of March can be dedicated to tweaking, fixing, approving
 
Should be turned in by end of March or beginning of April. Grad school needs time for review

Generally 60-100 pages, sweet spot at 75

Following plan means that in April, a thesis can be trimmed to a 10 page conference paper and submitted.
