##Transmedia overview

###Creating a storyworld
On creative-based projects, creating a storyworld is needed, and can be decided from an artistic perspective. Design thinking isn't needed here necessarily.

Research should always heavily focus on case studies

Research should have:

- Blue sky research - possibilities
- Problem-based research - how do I do this
- Validity research - have other people do this

###World building
Build a space in which people can play. This isn't a story, but a framework for a place where people can learn, explore and interact. 

- Create a logline
- Mark influencing events
- Create decision points
- Build milestones

###Narrative elements
If you're creating a narrative, you need

- Characters
- Plot
- Conflict
- Tension
(yeah, of course you do...)

If not a narrative, what kind of story world is it?

- Evocative spaces
    - a realm where people can create their own stories
- Enacting spaces
    - A place where solving goals contribute to an overall story
- Embedded narratives
    - non-linear stories, uncover bits and pieces as you experience the events
- Emergent narrative

Create mystery boxes

Every experience should include Bartle's Taxonomy

###Engagement mapping

Ask yourself, in every experience:

- how are you cross-linking, promoting and sending people through your experience?
- Have you mapped out the narrative experience of your users?

Once you've built these things, piece together work for what it might look like for a user. Make sure that Bartle's types and the 90-9-1 ratio are all represented

###Do this unless you're making science
You can't build a story world until you know your problem. If you're doing a science-based thing

- understand the nature of the problem
- other bullshit


###Before you do anything

- Create a budget (that won't be filled)
- Needed assets
- Deadlines
- Single project management tracking

##Design brief summary

###Philosophy of design brief document
The brief is the main tool we'll use for tracking work in the labs. It's important because when you leave, many projects will live on. We need a mechanism to communicate with people you'll never meet.

The document is a communication tool.

###The problem space

- Science
    - In science, this should be as deeply researched as a lit review. 

- Art
    - This premise is based upon an idea you want to communicate. This idea guides your research

###Problem statement
- Science
    - Tons of stuff needs to be done
- Art
    - Figure out how you want to communicate
    
###Ideation

###Usability
