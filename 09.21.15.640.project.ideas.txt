#Project ideas

## Big
### Start a fake cult
This idea is extreme and scary, but it involves a lot of deception and subterfuge. That being said, it could be really fucking fun.
We start a 'movement' on campus based around some kind of belief system, offering people ways to 'manage stress' or 'unlock their potential'. The truth is, it's all bullshit. We use [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) to our advantage and sculpt people's opinions about things, making them believe they came up with the idea to join our fake group in the first place.

#### Pros:
- Lots of deception, secrecy, disinformation
- If it can be pulled off, it will be *hugely* impressive

#### Cons:
- Could veer into legal issues very quickly
- Secrecy would have to be absolute, maintining our lies would be important

### "Missing Author" ARG
We build an ARG revolving around a mysterious missing obscure sci-fi author from the 1970s. Players would discover the story of this character via a whole range of medias, from websites discussing him to even literally putting books into bookstores and libraries. We'll have to craft the narrative pretty well and let people discover what happened to the author.
By the end of 9 weeks, we could coordinate an on-campus event where the author will show up somewhere and give a speech or presentation or something.

####Pros:
- Lots of writing to be done, in many media and styles
- Lots of finding fan groups to infiltrate

####Cons:
- There's a chance nobody will give a shit about the guy
- There will need to be a lot of communication and maintenance of the story about the author.


##Small

###Minnetrista orientation
We orient people to the small area of forest and houses in one part of Minnetrista. There are a lot of really cool old houses there and plenty of twisting paths. The orientation could take the form of some kind of adventure game, with the players solving puzzles and mapping their space as they go along.

Pros:
- Involved in the Muncie community
- Small space to work with, but lots of history

Cons:
- Minnetrista may not want to do it
- Lots of physical objects need to be created

(Note: Christy Woods can also be used, and would be much easier to get approval, if any is needed at all)

###Downtown Muncie orientation
We orient people to downtown Muncie, and players pick up parts of a story as they move along. It's like a scavenger hunt, but it's not just "go to x, get y", there's a real story that ties in various aspects of Muncie's community, maybe in an espionage setting?

Pros:
- Can be done passively, without having to directly involve business owners
- Large space to work with, but still walkable by people

Cons:
- Limited types of businesses downtown make story choices fewer
- Lots of chances of interference in the story from people outside of the experience

###Bracken Library orientation
