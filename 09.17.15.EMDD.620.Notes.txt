##Prototyping

"Wizard of Oz" prototyping...prototyping where someone behind the scenes is pulling all the levers and arranging things in the background while the user is testing, producing a result that is akin to using the actual product.

*ex: a voice-controlled web browser, someone is navigating with the actual existing interface while the user is just experiencing the 'voice-controlled' prototype.*
