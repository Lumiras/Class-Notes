#Marketing Plan

##Audience
All of our data points toward our key audience being millennials, 18-34. Our Facebook data shows that 72% of the people looking at our posts are in that range, with a females having an edge over males (43% vs. 28%). This means that while our marketing may want to trend more toward females, we should also cater to males since they do make up a large portion of our audience.

##Stray Ideas/brainstorm

- we’ll be staging this just as the Christmas shopping season is getting into full swing. This means a lot of people will be shopping. We can exploit this by putting our message in places where lots of people will be passing by (malls, retail stores).
- On the other side of things, getting people to pay attention to us in this period could be really difficult, since they’re already wrapped up in end of the year and holiday stuff.
- People’s calendars are full at this time of the year...an event that requires them to come to a certain place at a certain time could be tough to draw people in, since they’re already busy.

##Marketing strategy/calendar
###Nov 16-22: Priming/viral marketing
At this point, we should have a good idea of what we’re going to be doing, or at least be down to one or two prototypes. 

####To do in this period:
- Cryptic messages/flyers placed around campus and in other areas
- Teaser posts on team FB page
- Creating new FB page/event for project
- Building teaser website for project, include some encoded elements, see if anyone gets interested. 
- Start building full website/digital component
- Start looking at sponsors (I’m going to work with Elise on this).

####Considerations for this period:
If we need a venue, we need to start looking for it and hopefully secure it during this period. Holiday parties and other holiday activities may be claiming a lot of rentable spaces during the time we’re doing the event.
If we are going to have a budget, we need to figure it out and get it to Brad during this period...to do this, we’d need to be down to one specific prototype.

###November 23-29: The dead week
This is a tough week to deal with, since there will be so much disruption with Thanksgiving. Our contacts for sponsorship/venues will probably be MIA, as will people who may be interested in going to our thing. 
Considering this, actual reaching out and getting in contact with people in this week will probably be next to nothing. But, since Sean hates shopping and will probably be at home most of the week, there is still work to be done! This week will focus on production of marketing materials, as well as determining an aesthetic for the entire project

####To do in this period:
- Deciding overall asethetic for project (colors, fonts, other design choices...these will be seen in marketing materials first, but we should have a consistent design throughout marketing and production).
- Designing and possibly printing any physical marketing materials we’ll need.
- Building up more teaser content in real world/online, if there seems to be interest for it
- Finishing website/digital component for project, get it ready to deploy by the 30th

####Considerations for this period:
- Communication and coordination will be vital in this period. It'll be disrupted, but we need to be able to make a lot of decisions and make a lot of things during this time. Considering that, we need to determine how much autonomy each person has to make stuff.
- Printing costs money, so if we can have our budget at least approved before this week, we can actually spend some cash. Black and white everything would be boring

###November 30- December 4: Holy shit, this has to be done?
