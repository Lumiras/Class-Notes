###What is a Transmedia Experience?
[Transmedia quick overview, maybe example projects]

##Problem Statement and Goal
Express problem statement:
"Elicit continued engagement and connection to the ISO classical series through a transmedia experience containing both digital and physical spaces that targets an audience of non-musicians, despite a lack of interest in the series."

Express goal:
"The Design Challenge is to explore transmedia experiences that can engage audiences outside the symphony, particularly those who might be inclined to come.‚Äù

##How We Brainstorm

In our brainstorm sessions, we use post-it notes. On these post-its, we write small ideas, four or five words at the most. This allows for you to generate a lot of ideas quickly, without having to get bogged down into the details.

After the brainstorm, we organize the post-its into groups linked by ideas, making connections between the disparate ideas.

The end goal is to synthesize the data into interesting findings and create insights that will be useful in creating design solutions.


##Brainstorm One - What is Important About Classical Music?

We will give you two minutes to write down as many ideas on the post-it notes as you can about the following topic:

"Why is classical music important?"

##Brainstorm Two - What Keeps People from Going to The Symphony?

We will give you two minutes to write down as many ideas on the provided post-it notes as you can about the following topic:

"Why do you think some people find going to classical music concerts alienating or intimidating?"

##Brainstorm Three - What Do You Like?

Now that we have thought about the strengths and weaknesses of classical music, we want to know what you like to do, both physically and digitally.

"What live events or performances do you find engaging or exciting?"

"What are your top three favorite activities to do on digital platforms?"

##Short Break

At this point, we'll take a five minute break to momentarily decompress from the previous two brainstorming sessions in order to gather our ideas for the third brainstorming session.

##Brainstorm Four - What Would You Make?




##Voting

Now, we vote on the best ideas from the brainstorming sessions to see what we've come up with. Each participant will vote on their three favorite ideas from the previous brainstorming session. 

From these favorite ideas, we'll work to integrate the best into our project.

##Conclusion

To conclude, we would like to thank you so much for participating in this brainstorming session. We've found that the best ideas can come from anywhere, so your contribution helps us so much to hear your input.
