##Questions for Sean Stewart

- What is your process for planning a non-linear narrative? Do you start with a more traditional outline or treatment, or is the planning radically different from planning a linear narrative?

- When do you begin to make decisions as to what medium each piece of the narrative will exist within?

- Are there certain subject matters or genres that you believe work better as part of a transmedia experience, or do you believe any topic could be made into a successful transmedia narrative?

- How much do you concern with yourself with how the reader/user will interact with the transmedia story, or do you create with the confidence that the reader/user will understand how to move through the world you've created?

- How do you account for the fact that readers/users may miss important story points if they don't have access to a certain social media network, hardware platform, or other limitations? How can you catch these people up if they want to experience the narrative?

##Notes from Sean Stewart Talk

Volumetric Capture - 3D mapping a person with ~50 cameras

Working with MagicLeap (AR company)

###Transition from traditional media to transmedia
- Was a sci fi novelist
- There are more jobs in things touched by computers than being a mid-list sci-fi author
- New Media Guru is a much more lucrative field than mid-list sci-fi
- Had a friend who had a friend that lead him to Spielberg
- AI was a serialized story
- After killing a character, they received thousands of condolence letters for a fictional character
- In a non-linear story, people grow more attached to a character, they feel a more personal connection. They were as real to you as a distant cousin.
- They were using the same kind of formats of communication as we use in our everyday lives
- Did you know what was happening in the serial from the beginning?
    - Yes. Storyline was devised, they knew where they were ending up.
    - Major arcs were plotted out definitively, but the overall story was shaped by the users
    - One thing, media contractors entered a sound file about "The Red King" without the producers knowing about it. The audience reacted to this character, and they built 
- How do you approach marketing-focused campaigns vs. strictly creative?
    - Try not to treat these differently, and companies doing these things are usually pretty permissive of making something very creative
    - You have to stay in the IP's guideline
    - Less latitude now than before
    - When your'e tied to marketing, you pick up the phone when the big companies call
- Reason he quit making ARGs
    - Prompted to make Saw IV ARG, didn't want to make immersive torture porn
    - Severed thumb drive
- Business model for selling this entertainment?
    - Still the wild west
    - A lot of ARG techniques have been co-opted by social media marketers
    - Now you assume new characters in a show or a movie will have a Twitter account, will be using these kinds of tools to stretch into the real world
    - the traditional "watch free, have ads" model is falling apart, subscriptions are becoming the main means of consumption. TV ads don't work.
    - right now people are trying every way to make money, they don't know where the gold is right now, they're prospecting
        - Buy once
        - IAPs
        - Subscriptions
        - Product placement
        - Traditional
- What drives users to participate in your experiences?
    - Initial engagement is driven the same way as anything else: 
        - fame 
        - hype 
        - attention
    - People cared about I Love Bees because of Halo. When they did Last Chance Poker with Gun, nobody came, even though it was a superior experience
    - Creators want to cede agency to the player, but they often don't give them instructions. When they see something confusing, they bail
        - Give people instructions, let them know what they need to do
        - We always underestimate how much an average reader understands your thing
        - A community can be a helpful 'UI', can help onboard players
            - When it's a solo experience, the creator has to do the heavy lifting
- HBO Voyeur
    - 2007-2008
    - Rear Window-style experience, desktop app
    - Shows apartment building, you see various scenes
    - Interconnected stories via the vignettes within the rooms
    - Really great concept, but mechanically complicated. Not many people were willing to go through the entirety of the experience
    - 1% of people loved it, but the other 99% 
    - Page one really matters. You'll 
    
- How do you account for the fact that readers/users may miss important story points if they don't have access to a certain social media network, hardware platform, or other limitations? How can you catch these people up if they want to experience the narrative?
    - This was a huge problem in AI. Two weeks into the experience, things really blew up, but people 
        - Wrote a 'story so far'
        - Players build lore, compendiums to catch up
        - Even after this, there was conflict 
        - Made word 'trout'. This meant "You're a newcomer, I'm going to tell you to go to the resources, I'm not going to explain this further"
- The Beast was puzzles, I Love Bees was more location based, easier
- Year Zero was a huge work of art
    - Story beats are revealed through websites
    - Everything happened at one moment, so new revelations were all adding extra info to the situation, but you didn't have to 'follow' the story
    - Much flatter, much easier for a newcomer to experience
- Synchronous vs. Asynchonous art
    - Ballet starts and finishes, but happens in real time, you can't go back to that performance again
        - As a novelist, this model sucks. 
        - Time-shifted synchronous events 
    - How do you keep the heat of a live experience while making it not be stale right after it's aired/put out
    - This problem always exists, it
    - Cathy's Book was a direct response to this problem
- Didn't know Cathy's Book was going to be a book at first
- Can you make an experience for everyone, or does it need to be specifically tailored?
    - The audience makes more of a connection when it's your own
        - You feel like a part of it, you feel like you made it
        - The power of the success of a collective intelligence is real, and when one person succeeds, everyone feels like they succeed
        - You want to feel special, you want to feel like you've discovered something nobody else saw...you were the key
        - Marketers don't want to tell people 'buy my thing, buy my thing, buy my thing'...they would love to have people be searching for their thing
        - You can go from one person discovering a thing at one moment to 
        - Put something in the paper in Istanbul in the morning, and everyone in Iowa will know about it by sundown
    - District 9 bus campaign
        - Bus seats wrapped with "no aliens here"
        - Everybody who saw this knew what the movie was about from seeing these little bits
            - Drew racial allegory out very quickly and very directly
    - Browse BuzzFeed for a day, you learn how to get people's attention and make them do things 
        - Online narrative that begins with an online quiz
            - At end of quiz, says 'you are most like Jan'...the player then notices this character in the show it's tied to and gets upset or gets confirmed...but they're watching the show, they're engaging
- Can you create a sustainable ARG that continues to live on even after creators aren't tending to it?
    - Twine is a good resource...
    - Hootsuite allows for queued social media messages
    - If you want to react to your audience, it's going to be hard

##What he's working on now

Ink Spotters

Can I make an ARG for your mom?

The player chooses their journey through the narrative (Her Story)

Moved to this because it's hugely expensive to produce ARGs...games allow for 

Ongoing problem with CYOA models, if they're done really well we call them video games...if they're not done as well (Choice of Games), they can't be produced at the same fidelity.

CYOA is permanently corrosive to suspension of disbelief

CYOA isn't all that successful (this is wrong, it's just being refactored)

Ink Spotters tries to solve this, give them a discovery mechanic but is also relatively frictionless 

When we do the Beta...is it fun? Just play it

Would this be good for a non-gamer?

QA and testing questions 
- What's broken?
- Where did I get lost?
- Where did I feel dumb?
- When did I get bored?

##Post conversation

Creators aren't worried about what they don't know. They make. They will find out as they go along.

roll up your sleeves, create, iterate. Most importantly, fail.
