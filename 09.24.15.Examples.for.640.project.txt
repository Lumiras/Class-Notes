##Thematic Guides

###Tone
- [*Twin Peaks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks)
    - The darkness beneath the American Dream 
    - The awful things people do when they think nobody else is watching
- [HP Lovecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft)
    - Unspeakable horrors, terror creeping at the edges. 
    - The description of something awful can be more powerful than actually seeing it.
- [Raymond Chandler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Chandler)
    - More darkness underneath society. Seeing that, when given enough leeway, humanity becomes monsters
    - Tough-guy tone, signature noir/crime style
- [*Bioshock*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioshock)
    - Society exists on a thin thread, and can fall apart at any moment. 
    - Give people paradise, and they will find a way to ruin it.
- [*You're Next*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_Next)
    - Betrayal, the capacity for horror, even with your own family.

###Blurring reality and fiction
- [*The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stigmata_of_Palmer_Eldritch)

    - Realities collapsing in on each other
    - Characters appearing suddenly in other media, hidden messages in otherwise bland content (when graffiti appears in the background of a cleaning product commercial)
- [*The Institute*](http://www.theinstitutemovie.com/)
    - Very questionable division between reality and fiction, both inside the experience itself and within the film itself
    - The whole thing could possibly be fiction...

    -
