###Professor Garfield presentation
####Bob Levy

Bob proposed PG idea to Jim Davis as an educational tool

started around 2002

Tom Kinghorn, chair of PGF

president of online division of Pearson came aboard onto PG, gave them millions of dollars of unused content...

Site was built from disparate parts, welded together as time went on.

MM storytelling, new site, they're very proud of it...


##Q&A session with Bob and Derek

###IA/site nav questions: Me, Erin, Ryan
Almost all of the site is an iframe wrapped around other people's content. Very little of the content is original.

Ad banner at the top is for partner content...but there are links to that content on the front page. Why do you have ads for your own content?

COPA (Children's Online Protection Act) laws are a major part of the design of PFG. Marketing to people under 13 is highly regulated.

Both Flash and HTML5 sites will be maintained. Holy fucking shit.

No new content will be made without new grants.

They want a mobile site too. This is a joke.

All new content will be HTML5

They have no plans to sunset the Flash site. None. It hasn't even been a conversation.

After School Network very interested in 3D printing.

G-Cubed is the most popular portion of the site. 

They allegedly have no control over their content, but it's all Garfield branded. Why do they not have any control over it?

###How teachers use the site: Briee, Aiste
They say the lack professional development, a how-to site for how to use the site

So, they don't want to re-do their shitty site, they just want to create an extensive guide on how to navigate their shitty site. Because they've invested *so much (already spent and won't be recouped...) money*

They don't sell stuff...too much.

They're spending tons of money, but I thought they said running the site cost no money???

They sell "digital lockers"...???

Chicago Public Schools are a partner, they can buy stuff from PGF. 

Teachers tell other teachers about the site, there is no direct advertising.

SETDA (State Education Tech Directors Association)

Jenn suggests doing a transmedia site surrounding "Support Your School" month

ISTE, it's a teacher convention...they advertise at it.

###Analytics: Tanner, Jess
Site traffic drops to 1/3 during the summer. This is only used in schools.

They've created 70% of the content, allegedly. The other 30 is partner content...but partner content is given almost all the links from the front page.

Content is created with assistance from educators.

###Student UX: Ben, Holly
**For being a non-profit, they sure talk a whole lot about money!!!**
Of course, they're hiring people in India to do further development. It's all about money.


They did a large shuttering and recovering of content on a portion of the site designed around kids with ADD/ADHD and dyslexia. And, of course, the best way to format a site to help kids with ADD and dyslexia is a site that changes its naming conventions and site structure **all the time**

No consideration for accessibility. None.

They had to do an ADA-compliant game, but they did no actual research into how to make things accessible. They just sort of did what they thought might work.

Money money money money money money money money. Most used word of the day.

###Jenn's notes
How the site focuses on digital literacy, STEM

Is it possible to present a top level nav that allows you to then filter down into the other categories? There better be.

Wants him to do an inventory on what can be changed and what cannot be changed.

Maybe we could do some of the coding. Why pay people in India when you can have grad students work for free?

###Main big-picture challenges for PGF
- Getting feedback from teachers regarding site content
- How to make the site easier to use when you first visit it
    - Maybe make a video explaining how to use the site. They aren't really interested in making a well-designed site, just describing how to use a poorly designed one!
    - Section off by grade level
        - But maybe section by subject matter?
    - Personalization for the end user

###For next week
Show work done in the previous week

We may get beta site access, but don't worry about where they are going.

1. Polish intro and design analysis based on today's findings
2. Low-fidelity prototypes
    3. ideation of how things can be improved
4.
