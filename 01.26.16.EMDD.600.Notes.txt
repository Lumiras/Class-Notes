#Cognitive Walkthrough

Focuses on how easy it is for new users to accomplish tasks with the system

Cognitive walkthrough is task-specific, whereas heuristics evaluations are more holistic.

Walkthrough is point-to-point, checking for friction along the way

Emulating paths a new user would take to complete a task

##Process

1. Task analysis that specifies the sequence of steps or subtasks required by a user to accomplish a task, and the system responds to that action
3. Designers and developers walk through the steps as a group, asking themselves questions at each step
5. Data is gathered during walkthrough and a report of potential issues is compiled
6. System is redesigned to address the issues identified

---

- Usually 10-20 tasks
- Make tasks broad enough to engage a user fully, don't guide them down the exact path.
- Don't let the task guide them, give them an objective.
- Avoid language specifically used within the interface. For example, if you want them to buy a pair of shoes, and you have a "buy" button, it will lead them on. Use a synonym instead
- Broad tasks are much better than detailed subtasks
- This is a good way to avoid putting users through useless tasks. See what you can find out on your own before you put it in front of users
- Try to write subtasks that specifically exclude certain actions (don't use the search bar)

Typically, 4 questions are asked:

1. Will the user try to achieve the effect that the subtask has?
2. Will the user notice that the correct action is available?
3. Will the user understand the subtask can be achieved by the action?
4. Does the user get appropriate feedback?

#Contextual Inquiry

The core premise of Contextual Inquiry is simple: go where the customer works, observe the customer as he or she works, and talk to the customer about that work. Do that, and you can't help but gain a better understanding of that customer.

##Design from data

- The user is not like us
- We need data to understand users and their work
- We need specific instances of experience

##Key Benefits

- Systematic method for gathering and representing data about the user and their work
- Requires design team to agree on common observations and their representation
- Reveals hidden aspects of work that may be implicit in user's activity

##Key Principles

- **Context**: See the work where it unfolds
- **Partnership**: Make yourself and the user collaborators in understanding your work
- **Interpretation**: Assigning meaning to design team's observations
- **Focus**: Shared starting point, orienting the team and user toward a common goal



##Self-report vs. Observe

**Retrospective accounts are often summaries**
- "I got to work, checked my email and had a cup of coffee"

**By being present in the time and place of activity, we can get a much richer view of the data**

- Report on actual activity
- Reality can and will surprise us
- Avoid abstract details and focus on facts
- Think in terms of master/apprentice

##What to look for

Besides getting the picture of what happens and how the activity actually unfolds. Look for: 

- Workarounds (shortcuts, problem solving)
- Mismatch between what people say and do
- Offhand, under the breath comments
- Sighs
- Rolling of eyes
- Confessions

##Early design ideas

CI is a fine time to get initial feedback on design ideas

"If you had a device that did X, would that solve the problem?"

Users will quickly understand the intent of your suggestion and will be able to provide direct feedback

this will also demonstrate your understanding of the problem, providing opportunity for brainstorming and/or clarification

##What to avoid

- Not being inquisitive enough (settling on just watching)
- Overly disrupting the task
- Turning it into a regular interview
- Failing to respect your participants
- Failing to observe and take good notes
- Focusing on the wrong details
- Slipping into abstraction

##Interpretation

Check your interpretations of the user's actions to make sure they are accurate.

"I saw you removed that recipe, is that because you didn't find the right ingredients?"


##Interview Flow

- Interview/warm-up
- Transition
- Observe behavior
- Share interpretation
- Refine interpretation
- Repeat past 3 until needed
- Wrap-up

#Work Models

##Collecting Material

The outcomes of a contextual interview are:

- Detailed notes on (anonymized) user activity
- Pictures/videos
- Physical artifacts

##Team interpetation

The results of each interview are discussed, refined, elaborated, shared and represented withinthe team

The results of team interpretation are:

- Numbered notes (including observations, annotations, design ideas), indexed by user (e.g. P2, N38)
- Individual work models

##Roles

###Example of roles
- Interviewer
- Participant
- Note Taker

##Work Models

- **Flow**: Direction of communication and coordination (which stakeholder communicates with which stakeholders?)
- **Sequence**: Detailed sequence of work steps (what happened when?)
- **Artifact**: Physical objects that support the work (what is used during the activity?)
- **Culture**: External influences (what influences the actions?)
- **Physical**: Layout of work environment (where does activity occur and how is this place articulated?)
    - Blueprint

###Flow Model

Identify:

- Relevant stakeholders and their roles (same person may play different roles)
- Main tasks of each role
- How they interact and for what purpose
- Breakdowns (things that go wrong, or can be improved in the coordination, communication flow)


###Sequence Model

Identify:

- Low-level, step-by-step information on how the activity is actually done
- Main intents of user
- Actions to complete each intent
- Triggers that determine an action
- Breakdowns (delays, interruptions, redundancies)

###Artifact Model

Identify:

- Parts of the physical environment where work happens
- Organization of space, groupings

###Culture Model

Identify:

- Profound reasons and motivations and influences surrounding user's decisions (from other people, peers, past experiences)
- Tone of the place, expectations, desires, written or unwritten rules and policies

###Physical Model

Identify:

- How physical space affect experience


##Consolidation

- Consolidating models across different users and interviews allows the team to see patterns
- Some observations may be missed - by consolidating several interviews, we can achieve better coverage
- Reduces likelihood of bias by one idiosyncratic user or interview
- Output of consolidation is one set of work models, which show main pattern and possible variations

###Affinity diagram

- One affinity diagram is generated by the team during the consolidation process

- Topic
    - Themes
        - Synthetic Points
            - Individual Notes

One technique: write each note on one post-it, and if the notes are exactly the same, just make stacks...no need to rewrite
