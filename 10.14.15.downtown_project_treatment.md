##Welcome to Muncie: A Primer
###Treatment

Welcome to Muncie is an audio tour of downtown Muncie, produced by the Muncie Board for Tourism. 

####Scene 1: Welcome to Downtown
The narrator, JESSE ST. JOHN begins the tour by introducing him/herself to the participant and then describing that the tour will take place in the form of short audio pieces that highlight many of the great features in downtown Muncie. The participant is then instructed to find the Normandy Flower Shop, identified by the flowers on the sign.


####Scene 2: Normandy Flower Shop
Jesse begins the tour at the corner of Charles and High streets, focusing first on the [Normandy Flower Shop](http://www.normandyflowershop.net/aboutus.html?source=header), noting that it was established in the 1940s and has been a constant presence in downtown Muncie ever since. The piece also mentions that Normandy provides not only flowers but gifts for all occasions.

This scene should be presented as straight and factual, it should sound like a boilerplate Tourism Board advertisement for a local business.

After this portion, the participant is instructed to head toward Barn Brasserie.

####Scene 2: Barn Brasserie
Jesse introduces the participant to Barn Brasserie, a somewhat new restaurant in downtown. Jesse starts to describe the foods on offer at Barn, when in the background a door can be heard opening. Jesse is distracted from the narration and turns to the disturbance. It is at this point that CAL MATTHEWS enters the recording booth. The two begin to talk:

JESSE
I...I'm sorry, I've reserved this booth for the next couple hours.

CAL
Really? It didn't say anything on the sign up page, it said this room was open.

JESSE
It's not, I'm recording something and it's pretty rude that you just walked in. You saw the 'On Air' sign lit up, right?

CAL
I thought that sign was more of a suggestion. What are you recording anyway?

JESSE (obviously flustered)
Do you mind? Seriously? You can tell I'm making something.

CAL
Yeah, what is it?

JESSE (sighing, resigned)
If you must know, it's an audio tour of downtown Muncie. I'm telling people about Barn Brasserie, giving instructions on where to look and what they should pay attention to.

CAL
Seriously? Hey, person listening to this, while you're looking at Barn, look up and to the right to the top of the building. You see how it says "Geiger Block"? I bet you didn't know that the building itself is the world's largest Geiger counter. If there's ever radiation in Muncie, the whole building lights up to let everyone know to take cover.

JESSE
That's...that's not true. None of that's remotely true.

CAL
Oh, yeah, totally is. My grandpa used to work downtown in the 40s, he said there was one time they were pretty sure there was some kind of Godzilla monster coming to Muncie because the building lit up like a Christmas tree. He and his friends ran off to a fallout shelter in Michigan they were so scared.

JESSE
That's not possible. Godzilla is a fictional monster.

CAL
Let's be honest, that's your opinion. The jury's still out on Godzilla.

Cal and Jesse continue arguing, but Jesse is eventually able to tell the participant to try to disregard Cal's intrustions and make their way down the block to the Caffeinery

####Scene 3: The Caffeinery
Jesse introduces the participant to [The Caffinery](http://thecaffeinery.com), a local coffee shop, noting that it's locally owned and serves a wide variety of coffees, teas and other treats. Almost immediately, Cal once again interrupts Jesse, telling the participant that The Caffeinery isn't the most interesting thing in within view. Instead, the most interesting thing is the glass column on the Defur Voran building. Cal says that the column, hiding in plain sight, is a secret CIA elevator that allows for fast travel between Muncie and Hong Kong, noting that despite geographic evidence to the contrary, it is absolutely true taht if you just keep digging far enough down into the ground at any point in the USA, you will eventually reach China.

Jesse's anger with Cal grows, and Jesse begins to try to kick Cal out of the booth, but Cal reveals that he knows Jesse didn't pay to rent the studio space that he's currently using, and that if anyone found out he was misusing University resources, he could get fired from his promising internship with the Muncie Board for Tourism. 

Jesse sheepishly ends wraps up the recording by telling the participant to walk further down the street to the Fickle Peach.

####Scene 4: The Fickle Peach
Jesse tells participants about the [Fickle Peach](https://www.facebook.com/FicklePeach?rf=152691621455938), a restaurant and bar that occupies a building that was once a bank. Cal tells Jesse that this is false, that the building was never a bank, that it was used in the 1920s as a hideout for vampire hunters, as Muncie at the time was overrun with vampire hordes looking to infiltrate the jar and container industry the Ball Corporation had on lockdown at the time. The massive vault was, of course, used to imprison vampires who were wanted in other states for vampirism and other crimes. Cal begins to tell a story about Colonel Gustav Kharkov, the bravest of the vampire hunters, before Jesse abruptly tells the participant to go to the end of the street, at Charles and Mulberry.

####Scene 5: The End
