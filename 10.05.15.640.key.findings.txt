##Games research key findings

- Games have to strike a balance between giving the player a sense of freedom while simultaneously keeping them on a somewhat predetermined path to maintain story coherence. This is primarily done with visual and auditory hints to draw a player's attention to important sequences or rooms.
- The larger the environment, the more need there is for some sort of map in order to let the player understand their position. But, even in small areas a map can be helpful to the player to remember where they have gone and where they have yet to go inside a space.
- Giving players an enticing alternative to what they see as a predetermined path can be enjoyable for the player (especially Killers), while allowing the creator to still have control of the situation.
- Maintaining a consistent visual 'mood' provides good opportunity to subvert a player's attention.
