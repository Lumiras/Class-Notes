##NoExit brainstorming
met with Lukas, meeting result was that NoExit is on board, will serve as consultants for performance art, will allow us to use actors or other materials in our project.

Meetings on Wednesday, we can go.

Very enthusiastic to be a resource for us for everything

##ISO brainstorming

###What worked?
- They liked our process
- Recording the session
- Jared taking notes


###What didnâ€™t work?
- What people liked questions may need rephrasing
- Questions about suggestions should focus more on concepts, not execution...it seemed like the participants were focused on the 'how' too much


##Concert

###What stood out?
- Diverse audience
	- Was this because of just the event?
- Partnership with community organizations?
- Supplementary content was good, informative
- Interview with tuba player was engaging and entertaining
- There was a lot of casual dress
