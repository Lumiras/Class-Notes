##Authorea general presentation

###Bio

- Background in astrophysics and CompSci
- Had research position with CERN
- At CERN, he got to work on large-scale collaborations
	- Like, really large...hundreds of people involved
- Was part of initiative at CERN that pushed heavily for open access to all data
	- All of CERN's output is now open access
		- even collaborators with CERN must make that work open access
- Went to UCLA for PhD in Information Science
- Became an expert in scientific collaboration and authorship
	- How large-scale, distributed informational centers worked
	- How they communicated via email
	- Survey about personal connections between researchers
- Went to Harvard for Post-Doc for astrophysics
- Eventually didn't know what his career would look like at Harvard
	- His skills were specialized, and moving further into academia would require more specialization
- Eventually became a scholar with 30 publications and nothing to apply for
- Probably will go back into academia
- Wanted to start working on a product that would let people collaborate more easily
- The main thing he was doing was writing research papers. This is the currency of academia
	- Also complaining about the writing of these research papers
- Two things bad about reseaarch papers
	1. Doing a lot of data-driven work, but tools aren't keeping up. The data wasn't finding its way into the papers
		2. Working a lot in [iPython](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
	3. They were using lots of tools to collaborate on code, data, etc., but nothing to collaborate on the actual writing
- Started working on Authorea as part of post-doc work
	- Got funding from [SBIR](https://www.sbir.gov/)
	- Incorporated, almost for fun, to meet SBIR requirements
	- Didn't get the funding, but decided to continue
- Left post-doc work 2 years ago. Took a lot of risk (lost visa, insurance)

###Starting Authorea

- He knew nothing at all about making a business when he started Authorea
	- No knowledge of how to create LLC, c-corp
- Had to learn a lot about legalities, marketing, sales
 

###General Info

- Google Docs crashes at 15 collaborators
- Most of the data CERN produces has to be dumped, they don't have room

###About Authorea

- We are producing 21st century research, written with 20th century tools, packaged in a 17th century format
	- 4% of scholars us LaTeX, the other 95% use Word
- Word was not bulit to be used by groups of people on the web, they were built for single users working locally
- We are still just exchanging paper or paper replicas to dissiminate scientific data, we aren't using the full possibilities of the web
- [Gallielo's work](http://www.dioi.org/galileo/scans.pdf) was possibly more clear and cogent than our current data, because all the data was there. Now, we have gigs of data that goes into a research paper
	- He witnessed scientists taking rulers to a printed paper graph to extrapolate data
- **How would a modern Galileo do his work?**
- Collaboration is often a flurry of emails with no version control and no definitive way to check things
- He loves Google Docs and Dropbox, but they just aren't built for multiple people working on complex files together
	- Dropbox drops edits, saving only the newest
- Authorea uses Git
- The main goal of Authorea is to **make scholarly writing more fun**
	- Also changing the idea of academic publishing by making it more open and transparent
- Science has moved to secrecy instead of transparency, but science thrives on transparency
- They launched the [Open Science Index](https://www.authorea.com/users/2/articles/80071)
	- Measures things like retweets, downloads, people blogging about the work

##Authorea usability presentation

###Reasons for starting Authorea

- Was writing research papers with many collaborators, needed a platform that would facilitate it
- Wanted to build something specifically for academics
- Was inspired by open science movement
- Data doesn't fit in papers any more, is bad for scientific transparency

###Issues Authorea is running into

- Made by scientists and acadmics, so design and marketing isn't a strong suit for them
- Marketing is crucial, because people won't come to the platform without it
	- Not sure what search terms they're coming up in
- People don't know how robust their citations are
- Want to foster commenting and communication
- Publish feature hasn't been pushed much
- **Onboarding/sign-up is too bare, confusing**
	- initial sign-up is maybe too minimal
	- follow-up sign-up info is maybe too verbose
- Author name not listed on first doc, confuses new users
- Citation button is too small, gets lost in WYSIWYG toolbar
- Text reflowing on resize, commenting is confusing, disorienting
- Cannot export native .md
	- though can download via GitHub
- Export is slow
- No autosave

###Strengths of platform

- Integration with [intercom.io](http://www.intercom.io), allows quick and easy user support and engagement
- Automatically splits paragraphs on newlines or when text is pasted in
- Automatic citation generation/search
	- Anything with a DOI can be cited
	- can drag and drop from Zotero, Endnote, etc.
	- auto-highlights references when clicked in text
	- References embed links to DOI reference, can click through
- Standalone equation editor allows for powerful formulae creation and insertion
	- Transpiles LaTeX formatting, can paste formulae into other documents
- Automatic reference insertion
- Granular commenting on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis
- Image insertion based on [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
- Image files can have data inserted within them
	- Data inserted into files is kept in repo and can be downloaded
- Robust export engine
- Pushes Git commits automatically
- Allows for d3.js or other rich HTML embeds

###Audience

- 30% of hits come from organic search
- 30% from referrals
- 40% "mysterious mix"

###Branding and messaging

- Condense message into three words "Write research together"
	- May want more information in this message
- Haven't talked much to users or conducted testing
- Header image is confusing, looks interactive but isn't

###What they're working on

- SEO

###Misc notes

- Partnering with Google

#Jim Davis
##Garfield, creator - cat enthusiast

- people are more forgiving of animals than people
- nobody can relate to bugs
- first picture of Garfield standing up was drawn by Charles Schulz
- Garfield is still drawn, just drawn digitally. Nothing is cloned
	- He wants Garfield to continue evolving visually, cloning lines would prevent this
- The strip is holding a mirror to the reader. They find the humor in the fact that they want to be that way or they've thought that way
- Garfield relieves our guilt about the demands of modern society about body image, overworking, etc.
- No social or political commentary. It's all about the reader and what they want to say.
- You don't hate mornings on your coffee mug. Garfield hates mornings.
- **Garfield's message: "lighten up, we're not perfect"**
- Everybody else is doing political and social commentary, but Garfield doesn't want to do that
- No cruelty, no embarassment
- A comic gives you 7 inches and 25 words to get through all acts and a twist, animation gives you more leeway
- Because Garfield has a 94% recognizability rate, he can cut through a lot of attraction issues for new characeters or IPs

###The future of Garfield

- Doing a lot of work with Chinese companies making F2P games and licensing to other apps
- Want to sell emoji packs to messaging apps
	- other media companies are coming in, using emoji packs as publicity, making them free...can't sell paid emoji packs
- They want to make very mainstream [bland] apps that lay Garfield onto a proven [tired] mechanics. Angry Garfields???
- They just want to slap Garfield onto things?
