###Adobe DPS

Set of extensions and plugins for inDesign

Launched shortly after iPad launch

Good for making enhanced media without having to do a lot of coding and overhead

DPS can produce iOS-ready apps that don't have to be on the app store, good for testing.

DPS is a good prototyping tool for the low/medium level with the ability to possibly use it in making the high/final level work.

supports embedded iFrames
