##Questions

###Describe team environment of developing an exhibit
- Has core team and extended team
	- Core team (12-18)
		- Developer
		- Manager/producer
		- 3D designer
		- 2D designer
		- Creative media designer (fun)
		- Evaluator
		- Production (builders)
		- Interpretor for floor staff and actors
	- Extended team
		- Digital marketing
		- Physical marketing
		- Store
		- Facilities
- First thing when team comes together, a statement is made (big idea) that they hope everyone comes out of when they leave the exhibit
	- "the pirates and princess we see in popular media probably came from storybooks"
- Also develop 3-5 supporting statements
- Everything in the production flows toward these messages.
- Brainstorming
- Research can be extensive
	- for Pirates and Princesses, influences
		- Sleeping Beauty
		- Cinderella
		- Treasure Island
		- Peter Pan
- Independent brainstorming per department takes place, building toward those ideas in their own ways
- Production begins

###How do you avoid stereotypes in production?
- Nod to the stereotypes, but be inclusive
- Diversity within a team helps, creatively and background
- In *P&P*, there is a standup, cutout of traditional princess holding shield and sword

###Before brainstorming, where do the exhibits come from?
- Direction usually comes from exec team based on opportunity from an acquired object or corporate partnership, or sometimes trends.
- Every year, dark exhibit space is used to try out prototypes
	- VP of exhibits will bring these ideas to audience
- Large marketing study is done asking about desired content
	- Paragraphs about exhibits with ratings, sort of quick
	- Try to hit lots of demographics from this survey
	- Given to members and non-members

###With physical distractions, how do you get people to engage digital elements?
- Exhibit is designed early on to work with digital and interactive experiences
- Betas created along the way
- User testing is incredibly useful

###In brainstorming process, are there certain paradigms used often?
- Categorizing interactives
	- Decision tree
		- Branching paths
		- Consequences
		- Interactive narrative
		- Limited CYOA, 3-4 choices deep
	- Glorified labels
		- When something interesting or different is done with name placard
			- RFID leaf on Leonardo exhibit
- Large scale physical
- Small motor
- Pretend play
	- Can't be used all the time
- Don't make everything tech
- Healthy mix that engages people of different developmental stages and learning styles

###Specific example of interactive that tries to engage children and parent?
- Build a Warrior
	- Played with clay, built a warrior
	- Gave info about actual building of terra cotta warriors
	- Appropriate for young children, but physically tough so parent had to help with process
		- They try to do things like this often, building cross-interaction
- Terra Cotta Warrior chunks are designed to be too big for a single child
	- Balance difficulty and fun

###How do you build educational goals?
- Start with a hook, usually from exec team
- Core team gets together, gathers with other teams, has large brainstorming
	- Start identifying themes
	- Condense themes
	- Create big idea

###How do you approach something when your team doesn't have a ton of knowledge of the area?
- With Leonardo, independent research was needed
	- Scientific papers
	- Consulted palentologist, developed important ideas
- Brought ideas from research to brainstorm

###How do make specific cultural experiences inclusive and accurate?
- Sacred Journeys
- Museum researched with academic religon experts, practitioners of religion


###Removing singular digital experience
- Making sure experinece is succinct enough that it doesn't stop traffic
- Try to keep games under a couple of minutes, with a satisfying loop
- Test users for experience length	
- Mind instructions, keep them concise but clear what the player needs to do
- Get to the gameplay ASAP
- Design many multiplayer or multistation experiences
- Voice actor in You're On The Set
	- Dubbed voice cues from Scooby Doo episode for each individual part
	- Processed your (or your group)'s voices and played back
	- Had player number selection at the beginning, allowing for group or individual experience
		- Different clips based on number of players
	- Because galleries are loud, built makeshift sound booths with 360 mics that allowed a whole group to record
- Make it flexible to accomodate groups and individuals, prevents tunneling into one experience
	- Interaction took about 4 minutes
- Sweet spot of interaction is 60-90 seconds with an element
	- Total stay time in each gallery is 19-37 minutes, average 22-25 minutes
		- Studies show 20 minutes is overall average

###Details about user testing?
- Physical
	- Conceptual test
		- Whether visitors connect with the concept and the physical activity
		- Messages are set, concept is set
		- Have plan A, plan B at this point
	- Prototype
		- tested on the floor, make sure it physically works
		- Usually foamcore and paper, images and text
- Digital
	- Beta app is developed
	- Grab people off floor, have them test
	- Refine, make more concrete
	- As physical exhibit comes together, test on the floor
	- One round of user testing, try to do two

###Digital experience that really flopped?
- First versions almost never work out well
- Dragon activity (taking gold)
	- Originally designed as passive environmental piece
		- Some people would pick up on it, saw dragon noticing, treasure moving
	- Through testing, discovered instructions were needed to prime user
		- On screen text
		- Voiceover
	- Added resets
	- Originally showed player as orbs
		- Refined to shields and shovel as hands
	- Originally had fireball to shoot at player, dropped idea
- Language Kiosks	
	- Part of *Take Me There*
	- Flashcards with two languages, user talks back to prompts
	- Largely ignored
	- "Bermuda Triangle of Fun"

###How do you gauge if people are taking away the big idea?
- Interviews
	- What was this gallery about?
	- How would you describe this to a friend?
- Lots of top-of-mind thinking, need to find out in a moment what a person thought

###Did you ever change an exhibit based on testing findings?
- No whole exhibits changed, but some tech changes were made
- Panda area of *Take me There*
	- Game of panda care
		- A lot of instruction frontloaded (pandas are endangered, here's what they eat)
			- Originally actress delivered exposition
		- Gameplay started
			- *Diner Dash* style game
- Game was too tough, too much frontloading. Retooled, tightened
- There's no way everyone will understand your exhibit, there's no reason to burn it down

###How do you develop apps to extend the museum experience?
- Apps don't have to specifically link to an exhibit
- Stand Your Ground
	- Anti-bullying CYOA
- Usually develop apps to extend an exhibit experience
	- Take a the core educational goals, make them mechanics and concepts in app
- Create a worthwhile app that lets you learn and interact with the concepts

###Is there a marketing strategy for app dev?
