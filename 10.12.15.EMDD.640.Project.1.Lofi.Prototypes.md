Our top 5: #1 - battleship, #2 - trick or treat, #3 - dumbest spy game, #4 - audio (night vale style), #5 - audio (campus as downtown)


##Idea 1: Downtown Defense (aka Battleship)

The main idea of Downtown Defense is to get players to get to know the various businesses in downtown Muncie and what they have to offer. 

The players are tasked with fending off an alien invasion of downtown Muncie, with players defending various buildings in the area from alien attack. They do this by getting audio clues from a mysterious intelligence agency that feeds them information.

After getting the clues, the players consult two sources for information: a map of downtown, and a "leaked" guide from the invading aliens that gives information about the various businesses and establishments in the city.

As the players play the game, they learn all the great things downtown has to offer in a fun way while being competitive in trying to save the city.


##Idea 2: Trick and Treat
In the trick or treat scenario, participants are required to dress in costumes and participate in an early trick or treat activity throughout various Muncie establishements. The interesting part is that the trick or treat is very much a trick *and* treat, as participants have to make it through various humerous challenges on their way to getting their 'treats' at the end of every one of them. For example, ring toss with onion rings, or making beer can pyramids.

Participants also have a system to 'cash in' their treats at various points throughout the experience. Every time they complete a challenge, they are given some kind of chip or currency, and they can choose to either redeem their chips right away for small prizes, or to save up their chips in order to redeem nicer treats at later stations.


##Idea 3: Dumbest Spy Game Ever
Players enter the Dumbest Spy Game Ever as if they are the last in a line of participants in an ARG that has been in motion for years, but has never been completed by any participants. Players are given tons of print-outs and documentation talking about how incredibly difficult the game is.

When players actually begin participating in the tasks, though, they see that the tasks are unusually easy. A bomb diffusal game simply involves matching basic shapes with each other, for example. Completing each of these tasks leads the players through downtown, with breathless and dramatic narration the entire way provided by in-game documents.

Other highlights in the game involve the players encountering actors that are absolutely fed up with having to participate in this game years after it was supposed to end.

In the end, the player is lulled into a false sense that the challenges in this game will be entirely too easy to complete, but the last task they are faced with will be truly impossible to complete.

##Idea 4: Lost Stories of Downtown (aka audio (night vale style))
Players are given a map of downtown Muncie along with an audio device. They begin the tour by visiting some locations, and upon arriving at that location, they are told a story about the business/monument/whatever's history. The first few of these audio clips are very normal and straightforward, but as the participant moves further along the path, the entries begin to get more and more strange, referencing a version of downtown that doesn't appear to exist, or does it?

The stories told during the experience are at least based somewhat in fact, but the embelishments serve to make the experience more interesting to participants. 


##Idea 5: Virtual Downtown (aka campus as downtown)
This experience takes place on campus, with participants experiencing the idea that downtown is much closer than they think in relation to campus, and that the places in downtown are much easier to walk to than they may think. 

The activity essentially maps downtown to the confines of campus, using landmarks that would be familiar to students and campus visitors as stand-ins for downtown buildings. Maybe even some downtown esblishments could set up mini 'stations' on campus to make samples of their wares.

The experience is made lively through the fact that the audio narrator guiding them through the experience, despite seeming like the program is pre-recorded, is actually being streamed live to the participant.
