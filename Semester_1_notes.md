###7 principles of good design

####Visual Literacy
The governance by which we see and how we organize visual material, combining elements of structure with or without letters and words to create  cohesive whole

- understanding how visual info is organized
- An ability to evaluate the quality of visual info
- Competency in presentation of variety of visual material with clarity and effectiveness

##The 7 Principles
- Balance
- Proportion
- Contrast
- Harmony
- Focus
- Rhythm
- Unity

###Balance
Distribution of visual weight in a design. Can be symmetrical or asymmetrical.
- Projects a designed look
- Formal or informal appearance
- Maximized or minimizes stress

Lucky Jeans ad has good symmetrical balance

Asymmetrical balance is more active

###Proportion
Size and shape relationships among elements in a design. "If everything is big, nothing is big"

- Determines dimensions
- Creates a grid
- Injects natural order
- Subdivides space

###Contrast
Strategic difference among elements in a design. Can be done with color, shape, lines, etc.

- Attracts attention
- Increases visual clarity
- Attracts attention

###Harmony
Visual cohesion among elements in a single design. Harmony can be achieved through color, size, shape and type

- Promotes relationships
- Balances contrast

###Focus
Use of specific design elements to draw attention.

- Attracts attention
- implies importance
- creates emphasis
- creates rhythm 

###Rhythm
Use of design elements to enhance eye movements. Enhanced by repetition, hierarchy

- Attracts attention
- Implies importance
- Creates emphasis

###Unity
Visual cohesion among different designs within a collection. Unity is achieved through using common palettes, typography, and grids

##Remember
Visual messages...
- Are more quickly read
- Less subject to ambiguity
- More eye catching
- Say more in less space
- Progress in various patterns
- Can be viewed simultaneously
- Are easily remembered
