Research strong ties vs. weak ties, social network theory. How to build a crowd.

How to get people to do something for you:

- find the leaders. Find their Oprah, the person who will broadcast their opinion to everyone, and more importantly, everyone will listen to that person's opinions
- find the connections
- have the leaders do your things. Make them do it early. They'll talk about it. They'll inspire people to do it, to follow.
