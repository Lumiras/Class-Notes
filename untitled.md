##Authorea presentation

###Reasons for starting Authorea

- Was writing research papers with many collaborators, needed a platform that would facilitate it
- Wanted to build something specifically for academics
- Was inspired by open science movement
- Data doesn't fit in papers any more, is bad for scientific transparency

###Issues Authorea is running into

- Made by scientists and acadmics, so design and marketing isn't a strong suit for them
- Marketing is crucial, because people won't come to the platform without it
	- Not sure what search terms they're coming up in
- People don't know how robust their citations are
- Want to foster commenting and communication
- Publish feature hasn't been pushed much
- **Onboarding/sign-up is too bare, confusing**
	- initial sign-up is maybe too minimal
	- follow-up sign-up info is maybe too verbose
- Author name not listed on first doc, confuses new users
- Citation button is too small, gets lost in WYSIWYG toolbar
- Text reflowing on resize, commenting is confusing, disorienting
- Cannot export native .md
	- though can download via GitHub
- Export is slow
- No autosave

###Strengths of platform

- Integration with [intercom.io](http://www.intercom.io), allows quick and easy user support and engagement
- Automatically splits paragraphs on newlines or when text is pasted in
- Automatic citation generation/search
	- Anything with a DOI can be cited
	- can drag and drop from Zotero, Endnote, etc.
	- auto-highlights references when clicked in text
	- References embed links to DOI reference, can click through
- Standalone equation editor allows for powerful formulae creation and insertion
	- Transpiles LaTeX formatting, can paste formulae into other documents
- Automatic reference insertion
- Granular commenting on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis
- Image insertion based on [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
- Image files can have data inserted within them
	- Data inserted into files is kept in repo and can be downloaded
- Robust export engine
- Pushes Git commits automatically


###Audience

- 30% of hits come from organic search
- 30% from referrals
- 40% "mysterious mix"

###Branding and messaging

- Condense message into three words "Write research together"
	- May want more information in this message
- Haven't talked much to users or conducted testing
- Header image is confusing, looks interactive but isn't

###What they're working on

- SEO
- 

###Misc notes
