##Orientation Project

###Key Findings

###Constraints
- Safety of both participants and cast

- Clearly define expectations
	- purpose of experience (education), design/mood, establishing what kind of space it is before people go in

- Navigation system
	- players need to know what their next step can be, larger environments need more maps, games have to give the illusion of choice while guiding a player down a set path, tracks (haunted house), ease of navigation (houses)

- Options for exploration
	- Giving players chances to stray from the path is important, and makes players feel like they're in control of their environment, engaging different senses expands the experience, people want to know everything available

- Different levels of engagement available 
	- People don't want to feel pressured to participate, non-narrative engagement (haunted house)

- Spaces have to be compartmentalized 
	- (not that there has to be compartmentalized spaces) 
	- communal space, space for socializing, designated spaces, ownership of space
