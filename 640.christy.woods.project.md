##Orientation Game Project Proposal
###The Terror of The Woods

####Main idea:
Guide (orient) participants through an unknown wooded location, creating a horror experience via social tension and hints of great terror, without ever needing to actually show them things that are all that horrific. We explore how much terror we can create inside a person's mind by just planting seeds.

####The narrative
Players start in an off-site location, waiting to be picked up by our "researchers", to take them to the location for the "orientation experiment". They are picked up and taken to the site of our story, then blindfolded or otherwise sensory deprived under the guise of needing to get the players deep into the woods so they can orient themselves out.
When the participants are finally in the most remote part of the woods, suddenly something happens that disturbs the 'experiment' and spooks the researchers. The researchers run off and leave the players alone in the woods, abandoned.
The players then take off their blindfolds and realize they have no idea where they are...but their attention is soon drawn to a backpack near them. There is a phone ringing in the bag. One of the players picks up the phone and is introduced to a mysterious person, Reynard, who tells them they were just saved from having something horrible happen to them at the hands of the researchers. Reynard tells them that his group, the Sentinels, are busy tracking down the researchers, but that he/she will try to guide them out of the forest to safety.
As they proceed through the forest, the players are guided by Reynard, but they soon encounter strange things, like evidence of rituals or other disturbing events happening within the woods. The players get more and more tense as Reynard seems to be getting less confident in his/her ability to guide them as they wind through the woods.
At a certain point, Reynard seems to lose track of the group, and tells the group to count their members. Reynard tries to confirm that his group tracked (for example) three people being taken into the experiment, but the group realizes that there are four people in the group. Reynard tells them this is impossible, and that one of the people in the group has to be a plant put there by the 'researchers' to guide them back into danger.
After this revelation, the tension starts to mount as the players try to figure out who the plant is, and whether or not the plant has been guiding them to danger, right back to the 'researchers'. They may even question if Reynard is actually with the 'researchers'.
The players eventually get out of the woods (or the whole thing collapses as people don't know who to trust and we eventually have to extract everyone) and to safety. Soon after, the van they arrived in pulls up, and 'Reynard' is revealed to be one of the original researchers. The players are then told that they passed the test, and that they should await further instructions when "Phase 2" is ready.

####How it works

The experience is controlled by two main people, the narrator Reynard as well as The Infiltrator, the person that we place inside the group

#####Home Base
Home Base will be the nerve center of the operation, it will include Reynard and will likely be housed in the van we arrived in. The members in Home Base will also likely be working before or during the experience to leave clues in the area or to set up some of the strange things participants will see as they go along. Reynard will remain at Home Base as he/she guides the players through the experience.

#####Reynard
Reynard's job will be to guide the players through the experience, also giving them context and bits of story as they go along. The role of Reynard is to calm down paranoia and keep the group focused and moving through the experience.

#####The Infiltrator
The Infiltrator's role will also be to guide the players, as well as to even more directly influence the path the players will take. The Infiltrator's role will also be to increase paranoia and fear within the group, trying to get the group to fear everything around them.
The Infiltrator also serves a role of letting Home Base know where the group of players is currently. He/she will have some kind of GPS beacon that is broadcasting the team's location (this can be done with a phone really easily).
The Infiltrator will join with the group secretly, as they wait for the van to take them to the second location. This gives The Infiltrator time to blend in and cover up the fact that they've been planted.


####Terror through restraint
The whole point of this exercise is to create a scary, paranoid situation, but to do it not through showing them horrific things or jump scaring them to death. Instead, the experience will just plant seeds of terror in the player's heads, and give them just enough scary stuff that their imagination will do the rest for us. This keeps the budget down and keeps the number of moving parts needed to make something like this work much lower.
This seed-sowing will even take place during the safety orientation we do before the event. We have players sign a general safety/participation waiver (which we will legitimately need), but in that waiver we will include passages saying things like players may be exposed to scenes of graphic violence, extreme terror, and a whole list of other terrible things...things that don't actually happen, but that players will be expecting the entire time.

####Safety
Of course, leading people through the spooky woods and making them progressivly more paranoid comes with some safety considerations.
First, the presence of Reynard and The Infiltrator provide ways to calm down the situation as it goes along, making sure players don't get too out of hand or destructive.
In addition to our guides, we need to give players a method to just opt out and leave. This breaks our fiction, but it's needed so that we don't get sued.
