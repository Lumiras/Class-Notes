###The Wisdom of Crowds

####Four elements of crowd wisdom
1. Diversity of opinion
    2. Each person should have private information, even if it's just an eccentric interpretation of events
3. Independence
    4. people's opinions are not determined by opinions of others around them
5. Decentralization
    6. people are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge
7. Aggregation
    8. some mechanism exists for turning private judgements into a collective decision

These things make a group smart, if you can't satisfy these decisions, you will not make good decisions.

####How does this apply?

- create an envirotnment where there is a presentation of facts, not a discussion of facts
- Avoid social herding with debate coming after decision making
- Allow people to pull info form their own fields and spaces
- Create an aggregation method that extracts data from introverts and extroverts

####What does this look like?

- Set a task
- Create a uniform way to deliver all information to all people
- Allow presentations of same length, no debate
- enable ovting and aggregation in private, away from teh group
- Pull all data together, and use that as a springboard for discussion
- Re-rank and re-order as needed after

####Things that happen
- social proof (they are doing it, it must be the way to do it)
- herding (that's what my neighbor is doing)
- cascading (decisions made in order, not at once)
- confirmation bias (!!!)

####Types of problems

- cognition problems
    - those problems with a definite right/wrong or definitive answer
- Coordination problems
    - not only about what he believes the right answer is but also about what other people think the right answer is
- Cooperation problems
    - adopt a broader definition of self-interest than the myopic one that maximixing profits in the short term demands. They need to be able to trust those around them
