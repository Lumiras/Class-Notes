###Case studies and the creative lab

Should be making annotated bibs for all projects, even if it's not required.

Shared annotated bib page is available

Annotated bib sections should be cut+pasteable, able to put into a presentation.

A good structure lets you skim and scan easily.

Everything should be an ecosystem. Reusable, modular, adaptable.

###Questions
1. How do we take case studies and convert them into text for later use?
    - how can they benefit what you do in Creative Project lab?
2. How can we arrange the annotated bibliography?


###Big picture
- extensive approach
    - large data from lots of sources and putting info together
- Intensive
    - focus on one specific instance

A case study is a way to understand why and how something worked so we can know what we can build, how it's done, and what has come before.

###Micro vs. Macro
In general we will do:
    - Micro-level, one actor
    - Micro-level, more than one actor

*Deconstructing an event or an event with multiple people. 
You may use a combo of extensive and intensive approaches*

###A Case study
- boundaries of a system
- in natural context
- monitoring the phenomenon
- researcher focuses on process-tracking
- explore data then come up with ideas
- use multiple data sources
- bring stakeholders to debate findings

###Constraints
Determine what you are studying and what you are not studying.

- potential propositions
    - read literature, come up with ideas that frame your argument
    - if you have experience, frame the argument with that
    - create statements that lay out exactly what you want to study

###We did an explanatory case study
- understand the way the system worked
- Ethnography
    - interviews
    - read and reconstruct
    - diagram use cases
- Apply methodologies

####Exploratory case study
explore a situation that has no clear outcomes. Seek to understand what is at play

####Descriptive case study
Describe the phenomenon in the real life environment in which it took place. Unlike explanatory, you are just describing the what, not the how

###Reporting
the goal in any case study is to tell a story. You want to think of the description holistically. If you had people writing individual sections, you won't have a compelling story. You'll have a weird juxtaposition of style and content.

There is no way to break up a case study: you are simply communicating your findings based upon a methodology that you describe.

####Coming up in week 6
You'll be put in teams, tasked with designing an experience that creates an orientation for people.

We'll draw teams in week 6 so you can begin working on your projects.
