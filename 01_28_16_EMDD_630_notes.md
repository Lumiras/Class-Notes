###Hungry Todd Rungy

Documentary filmmaker. 

Tried to start HTR as a multimedia story, but based it on a traditional three-act structure.

Spent 5-6 years building story.

Difficulties and issues accumulated 

Co-creator was eventually forced by his wife to stop.

Wanted to make a satrical look at American consumer culture. 

Wanted to convince the world that Todd was a real person. He feels they achieved that.

Created character, basic setup, but didn't plan much out beyond that.

Cast co-creator because he could hold up all pillars in social media, recorded videos, and live events.

###What went wrong?

When things were coming together, everyone told them it was great, needed to be on cable, was the best thing ever.

So, because of this, they recut and retooled the story to make it something to pitch to network TV (IFC). 

Spent nine months cutting a pilot to pitch to IFC.

Tried to create too much on their own, with marketing, other outreach

####What were you missing?

Someone who had experience in marketing, branding, etc.

Also another editor

And someone who understood analytics

####How much information did you capture?

didn't really answer

Had the actor taking on a ton of responsibilities he didn't understand.

Wanted to entertain people and sneak in issues of social issues

If he could go back, he would have made it art instead of pursuing money

Seems like he's much more interested in acquisition instead of making good content.
