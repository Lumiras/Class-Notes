##Ethnography
Ethnographic field research involves study of groups and people as they go about their everyday lives. First-hand participation in some initially unfamiliar social world and the production of written accounts of that world by drawing upon participation is the core of ethnographic research

- Embedding with a community or culture, living in it and understanding how things operate
- Very qualitative
	- Field notes
	- Observations
	- Artifacts
		- pictures
		- sketching
		- objects
Where usablity is about how people directly interact with a technology, ethnography is how people interact with each other.

- Passive observation
	- As if you were a fly on the wall
- Active observation
	- Becoming a member of the team and learning how to do the job

Ethnography provides a more holistic approach than traditional study.

Children's Museum exhibits are like miniature transmedia experiences.

###Guiding questions

Qualitative research does not have the same research questions as quantitative studies.

Quantitative: "How does exercise affect lactose levels in muscles?"

Qualitative: "

When you have a measurable, testable outcome, you start with a research question.

With qualitative research, it's much more difficult to have a research question that discovers something that is relevant to anything beyond itself. Qualitative studies are often reflexive.

Quantitative measures may be used in a qualitiative study, but ultimately the data coming out of a qualitative study is an opinion.

###Gathering info

- Have a goal you can focus on, but keep in mind to not go into this with preconceptions
- Sometimes you won't know what's important until after your research is complete, when you're analyzing your research notes and applying them to technology design
- Put yourself into the shoes of those you're observing, get into their heads, understand their perspectives and expectations and accurately record and share that gained knowledge in an objective way that you can then use to support design deciisions later on

Capture notes on everything, not just bound to your guiding questions. You may discover new guiding questions as you go along.

You are not coming into this observation as a void. You should use your pre-existing knowledge about design, EMDD, whatever...use your knowledge to know what to look for.

- Ethnographic field notes
	- Provide useful ideas about what info you should capture
- Scene
	- Describe physical aspects of work environment
- Events and incidents
	- What happened, and who did what? What is your impression of these incidents, and what are team members' thoughts in regard to and interpretation of these events. How do you feel about them?
- Ethnography is active. You should be asking questions
	- However, it's not a group interview, so don't interrupt the subject too much. 
- Taking notes of observations isn't enough. You need to be able to analyze your notes and present your analysis -- in an enlightening, meaningful and credible way.

###Recording field notes

- Date, time, place of observation
- Specific facts, numbers, details of what happens at the site
- Sensory impressions: sight, sound, texture, smell, taste
- Specific words, phrases, conversation summary, insider language
- Questiosn about people or behaviors for future investigtation
- Page numbers to help keep observations in order

####Jottings

- Brief words and phrases written down while at site or in situation about which more complete notes will be written later
- Usually recorded in a small notebook, intended to help us remember things
- Not all research situations are appropriate for jottings at all tiems, they help greatly when sitting down later

####Descriptions

- Everything you can remember about the occasion you are writing about - a meal, a ritual, a meeting, a sequence of events
- It's useful to focus primarily on things you did or observed that relate to the guiding question, some general information is also good

####Analysis

- What you learned in the setting regarding your guiding question and other related points. This is how you make links
- What themes can you begin to identify regarding you guiding question?

####Reflection

- What you learned of a personal nature. What was it like for you to be doing this research? What felt comfortable for you about being in this site and what felt uncomfortable?
- While this is extremely important, it should be removed from analysis

###Develop Work Models

- Flow
	- direction of communciation and coordingation
- Sequence
	- Detailed sequence of work steps
- Artifact
	- Physical objects that support the work
- Culture
	- External influences
- Physical
	- Layout of the work environment

###Advantages

- Can open up certain experiences during group research that other research methods fail to cover
- Concepts that are taken for granted can be highlighted and confronted
- Can tap into intuitive and deep human understanding and intepretations of the accounts of the informants
- Allows people outside of a culture to experience that culture

###Disadvantages

- Deep expertise is required
- Ethnographer is an outsider and must exercise discretion and caution to avoid offending, alienating or harming thos ebeing observed
- Negotiating access to field sites can be time consuming and difficult
- Research can involve extended time in the field
- Ethnographers bring their own experience to bear in pursuing questions to ask and reviewing data, which can lead to biases in directions of inquiry and analysis
- Ethnography relies heavily on storytelling and the presentation of cultural incidents, which is inevitably selective and viewed as a weakness by scientists
