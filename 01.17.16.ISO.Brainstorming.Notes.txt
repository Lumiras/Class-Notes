Primary issues with ISO:
- Conductor is young, but musicians are older
- People associate symphony with holidays, may not realize orchestra operates year-round
- No unified graphic design or uniform presentation of AV materials, weak branding
- Public unfamiliar with various terms: philharmonic, pops, symphony, orchestra...what do they mean?
- Not enough personality. These are world-class musicians, they have interesting stories, but we don't know them.
- YouTube page is mostly promo, some informational...but no videos of full performances or songs from performances (may be copyright/license issue...but these songs are public domain, right?).
- YouTube page seems to feature a couple dozen different attempts at 'projects', but all very fractured
- General symphony problem: people don't know symphonies put on performances of classical music, may think that all recordings of classical music are from the composer.
- Social media is bland and seems like it's written via a form.

Number one issue: The ISO has no identifiable personality
