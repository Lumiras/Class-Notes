##General notes
Final presentations next week, show up in nice clothes and be presentable. You are 'graded' on presentability.

After this, 3 decisions need to be made. 

- do we stay in our group?
- do we make one large project or two smaller projects?
- how will we stage the project(s)?

Each group member will be assigned one of four roles:

- Producer
- Researcher
- Usability
- Audience/Marketing

Brad and Jenn went to [MIT's SOLVE conference](http://solve.mit.edu/)

[Jeffrey Sachs](http://jeffsachs.org/) gave a presentation about [UN Sustainability Goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300)

We can do things in Muncie that apply to larger, worldwide problems.

EMDD is not going to be client work or jobbing for big businesses. That's bullshit, we could do that anywhere. We are here to **solve problems**, big problems.

Brad, Jenn and Faith are putting together a list of 'moon-shot' projects, huge goals that we can target in year 2.


###Paws Meeting
Brad and Jenn have met with Jim Davis, looked at the future of comics...what happens when comics are no longer in newspapers (very soon).

The future of comics is transmedia.

Paws Inc. has a huge army of artists (writers, motion graphics, illustrators, voice actors, etc.) at our disposal.

###Elise asks: How do we get a job once we're done with this goddamn thing?

They are working on building up a symposium, have about 100 companies so far that may be interested.

Brad and his wife are joining the Columbia Club, they will be hosting lunches for writers/creatives semi-frequently.

You have to submit and get into the world. **This is how you get a job from this program**


##Presentations
We need to figure out the names and frameworks we're using for the things in our presentation.
